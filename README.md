# tradeioapi

A simple Python client for the Trade.io API v1

## Motivation
I would have preferred to use the generated Swagger client for Python 
but I anticipated problems with the Timestamp that needs to be passed
in when making signed requests as the swagger model does not include it.

## Releases
No release yet.
